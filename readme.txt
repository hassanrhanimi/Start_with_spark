In this notebook, we will go over the basics of Apache Spark and PySpark. We will start with giving some concept definitions, creating the SparkContext and SparkSession. We then create an RDD and apply some basic transformations and actions. Finally we'll present methods for creating Spark DataFrame & demonstrate the basics dataframes and SparkSQL and how to close the spark context ans session connections.

After this reading this notebook, you will be able to:

- Define RDD, DataFrame, Dataset, sparkContext, sparkSession
- Create the SparkContext and SparkSession
- Create an RDD and apply some basic transformations and actions on RDDs
- Demonstrate the use of the basics Dataframes and SparkSQL
- Methods for creating Spark DataFrame
- Close spark context and session connections
